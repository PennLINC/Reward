<p>This sub-project documents the processing of the e-prime
behavioural files. A fully documented tutorial of <em>how</em>
this is accomplished, with accompanying commentary,
is available at <a href="https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/Tutorials/itc_eprime_tutorial/">pennlinc.github.io</a> (this is just the initial attempt that prompted the tutorial documentation).</p>

<p>E-prime files were shared with collaborators at the Kable lab, and are still available at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/cbica/projects/wolf_satterthwaite_reward/Curation/code/itc_events_BIDS_tree</code>.</p>
