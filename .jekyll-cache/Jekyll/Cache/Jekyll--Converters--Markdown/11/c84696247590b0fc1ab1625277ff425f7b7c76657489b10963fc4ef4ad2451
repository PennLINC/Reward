<p>NEFF sub-project did not end up getting off the ground in time.
Preliminary BIDs data was downloaded at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/cbica/projects/wolf_satterthwaite_reward/original_data/bidsdatasets/neff*</code>.</p>

<p>The NEFF project spanned a small handful of separate and overlapping
imaging protocols, and so was left to the end to parse.
Ultimately, the task was not completed.</p>
