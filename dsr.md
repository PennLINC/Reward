# Dataset Status Report

## FNDM1 

RIA Store: NA

CUBIC Path: `~/original_data/bidsdatasets/fndm1`

Datalad Status: NA

Git Branch: NA

DSR: Adjusted heuristics and relevant data on Flywheel using `fw-heudiconv`, and output data to CUBIC using `fw export bids`. Currently no ASL data has been transferred (need updated ASL BIDS spec).

Next Steps: Update heuristic to accommodate most recent version of ASL data. Validate. Use `CuBIDS/BOnd` to validate and start grouping.

Data Narrative: `~/curation/code/DataNarrative.md`
