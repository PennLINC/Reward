# Parsing E-Prime Files

This sub-project documents the processing of the e-prime
behavioural files. A fully documented tutorial of _how_
this is accomplished, with accompanying commentary,
is available at [pennlinc.github.io](https://pennlinc.github.io/docs/Tutorials/itc_eprime_tutorial/) (this is just the initial attempt that prompted the tutorial documentation).

E-prime files were shared with collaborators at the Kable lab, and are still available at `/cbica/projects/wolf_satterthwaite_reward/Curation/code/itc_events_BIDS_tree`.
